		<h3>Education: where the free will ends</h3>
		<p>Hold on! I’m not here to bash educational systems. As a matter of fact, I want people to stop thinking of education as being nothing more than the educational systems.</p>
		<p>We live in a binary reality, where you can choose to do or not to do. We have the ability to do whatever we want; for some things we need to plan ahead, for some things we need to accomplish a whole lot of other things before we are able to do them, but there are no limits to what we can do. What we cannot, is avoid the consequences of our actions. That, I believe, is the philosophical foundation of free will.</p>
		<p>For many generations, people have felt, and still feel, that there is a disparity between the moments they spend learning, educating themselves, and all else. Living in an predominantly industrial society, we have grown to believe that education, much like working, is a confined experience that we’re forced into, in order to reap the benefits of our free time.</p>
		<p>People believe that the process of learning only happens when they wake up early and spend part of their days at school, or when they sit down at home for a couple hours of reading or writing. And then, at the end of those processes, they will wake up early and go to work, and occasionally spend time at home confining themselves in their professional lives.</p>
		<p>That’s not what I mean by “where the free will ends”. Quite the opposite. That contextualization of education is entirely wrong.</p>
		<p>Everyone spends every moment of their lives learning. Learning is the underlying, ongoing process, that never stops. Every experience polishes one’s ability to go through that experience again. When you go out with friends, you are potentially improving your social abilities - you are learning to live in a community; when you drink liquor, you are potentially improving your ability to do so in a not-so-harmful way; when you do the dishes, you are potentially improving your ability to do so faster, and better.</p>
		<p>When you observe someone doing something that is harmful, you are potentially learning not to do that. Learning from someone else’s mistakes.</p>
		<p>Every small action, every small interaction, opens the doors of perception and cognition to the improvement of the self. Everything is to learn something.</p>
		<p>When you clear your mind and meditate, your brain wires are undergoing an optimization process, re-organizing the knowledge that you have gathered so far. When you go to sleep, your subconscious mind is in action, again going through the knowledge that you have gathered, and solidifying it. You are learning.</p>
		<p>The acknowledgement of the fact that learning is always happening, allows the person to develop a very interesting mindset. A mindset that seeks knowledge through every action. It gives the mind a clear view of the experiences it wishes to undergo to improve itself, as well as the ability to improve itself while undergoing any experiences.</p>
		<p>Understanding what learning actually stands for, breaks the mind free of indoctrination. It destroys the wall that so many people build around learning, the wall that makes them hate learning. It empowers the mind to perform every action better than it did before.</p>
		<p>Your free will allows you to choose to remain in a confined perception of learning. You may choose to interpret this article the opposite way, just for the sake of it; but even doing so, you will be learning something that you can, then, teach everyone else.</p>
